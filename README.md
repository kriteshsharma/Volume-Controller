# Volume-Controller
This is a project which can be used to control device's audio using hand gestures
Hand tracking is a module that is used to track hands and is created as a different file so that we dont have to write whole code again just to track hands and to write the whole code again and  again.
Volume Control file contains the whole code and it runs along with the Hand Tracking module.
Volume of the system can be controlled by pinch in and pich out fingers.
